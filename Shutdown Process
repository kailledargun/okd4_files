If you are shutting the cluster down for an extended period, determine the date on which certificates expire.


$ oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver-operator get secret kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.auth\.openshift\.io/certificate-not-after}'

To ensure that the cluster can restart gracefully, plan to restart it on or before the specified date. As the cluster restarts, the process might require you to manually approve the pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates.
Shut down all of the nodes in the cluster. You can do this from your cloud providerâ€™s web console, or run the following loop:


$ for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host shutdown -h 1; done 
-h 1 indicates how long, in minutes, this process lasts before the control-plane nodes are shut down. For large-scale clusters with 10 nodes or more, set to 10 minutes or longer to make sure all the compute nodes have time to shut down first.
